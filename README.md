  - ECB, CBC, CTR, GCM modes
  - Text-mode and file-mode encryption

- **RSA Operations**
  - Encrypt / Decrypt, Sign / Verify text and file data

- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**
  - HKDF key derivation from Diffe-Hellman exchange
- **Hashing Utilities**
  - SHA1, SHA256 modes
  - Hashing for text and file data
  - Hash based functions (HMAC, HKDF)

- **Key Management (import/export)**
  - Key generation, secure storage for AES, RSA, and DH

### **Modern UI / UX**
